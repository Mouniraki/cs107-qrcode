# QR Code Generator
## A simple QR Code generator written in Java.

This is one of the two main projects of the first semester of my 1st year at EPFL, for the course "Introduction Ã  la programmation".  
Its main goal was to practice the main concepts shown in class, and understand the Java language in depth.  
The project was realized with Guillen Steulet, my teammate for this project only.
